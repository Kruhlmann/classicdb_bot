Even a priest with Benediction can upgrade on this mace.  I currently have Benediction which has 31 intel, +106 to healing.  Now, consider this.  If you trade in the staff on this mace you now have 18 intel / 84 healing.  Put this with the Fire runed Grimoire from Molten core and you have another 21 intel / 11 damage and healing. \r\n\r\nWith this setup you now have 39 intel and 95 damage / healing effects on your weapon set.  This shows an improvement of 8 intel = 120 more mana, and provides more versitility since the effect is now applied to damage as well as healing. \r\n\r\nThat said, A palidin could use it equaly well.  Though most of our paladins have Aurastone, or Jin'do's hexar already.  Bottomline, this is not MC gear...  It's the best in BWL gear.  Anyone using a caster weapon like this from MC can upgrade to this item.  I myself would like to see this prioritized for Druids / pally (I'm on the alliance so insert shamen where I say pally)since priests have other options.  Namely Benediction, but I'm content to let others upgrade to catch up to me, rather than take another stride ahead of a fellow guild member. \r\n\r\nAnother great item, very similar to this one, is the claw of chromaggus.  This is a dagger version of the same, offering only 1 less intel and 64 to damage / effects.(I think, too lazy to be exact or check : P)  What people have to think about here is this:\r\n\r\nWithin the instance are very similar weapons for nearly every type of mana user.  Be they mage / warlock / priest / shamen ~ pally.  In the interest of progress as a guild, which you will have if you ever see this drop btw, you should try to assigin the weapons.  This because while priests and pally can use maces, priests can also use daggers.  Try to keep yourself open to alternatives.  Great staff off Nefarian too @.@ You could argue, i did, that it's not really an upgrade for a priest.","date":"2006-12-09T05:12:37+01:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentv2":1,"number":6,"id":14280,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Ilikeguitaralot","body":"In reply to Rinkotsu: +22 Int would be a waste of money.

If a pally wants to do dps, he will gor for a real 2h dps weapon anyway. We had 2 of these drop, both were won by paladins.

Mind blast has 8sec cooldown without talents and you have no mind flay. The only other shadow damage spell you have is the dot. +Shadow damage on items is next to useless for a holy priest. You want +dmg&heal instead. I have about 400dmg&heal, that doubles my dps, makes me a really dangerous opponent in PVP with 1,7k smite crits and stuff and I can outdamage most people on 5-10man runs. Sometimes even when doing all the healing too, as long as I get time to drink back mana.\n\nThe dps on this is insane!

I assumed this mace would make up for what I was lacking in the other 2 talent trees to an extent. And with the new patch, even more so with a spellpower enchant placed on it. My previous item was Herald of Woe, but I had no decent 1-hander to allow me to use a shield so I decided to bid on it. With the highest dkp, of course I won on that count.
