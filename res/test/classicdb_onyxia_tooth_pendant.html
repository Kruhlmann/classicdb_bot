It *is* better, this coming from an attack power %^&*! rogue. I lose, what, 2 max damage? Without doing any calcs, I know that's less than 40 max damage to an ambush. What I gain from this? 90 HP, ~.5% crit, ~1% dodge and a very valuable 1% to hit. I always look at AP first, but when there are so many advanatages to the item over just the AP, ill go for it. Also, the 10 fire resist is always a nice bonus :P\n\nEdited, Fri May 27 15:42:52 2005","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-05-28T02:42:08+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":20,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"SladeMalGanis","importedSubject":"RE: best ever? no","contentTimestamp":"1117240928.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3065412,"id":1279418,"body":"12agi and 1% crit beats +30atk power, any day","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-05-28T15:56:21+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-7,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Daggerwolf","importedSubject":"RE: best ever? no","contentTimestamp":"1117288581.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3065412,"id":1279416,"body":"I as a hunter get per 1 agi 2 att power, which means  that i actually get +90 hits from stami and +24 att power from the agility from this, the loss off 6 att power is well... i couldt care less, i'd rather have the equips, this IS at the moment, for hunters at least, the best necklace","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-06-03T19:46:24+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-20,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"hammerz","importedSubject":"RE: best ever? no","contentTimestamp":"1117820784.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"usea","importedSubject":"best ever? no"},{"commentv2":1,"number":23,"id":3065413,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Best neck for all melee classes+hunters.
