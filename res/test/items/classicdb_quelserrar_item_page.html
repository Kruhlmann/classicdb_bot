Once you speak to him, he will give you a quest to forge the Quel'Serrar, which ultimately requires you to attend a successful Onyxia raid.\n\nWhen I went to Onyxia to complete this quest I was not the main tank and was assigned a healer whose specific job was to keep me alive so that I would be able to place the blade (Unfired Ancient Blade) in the ground at the appropriate time.  So basically I did my part to contribute to the raid, and then in phase 3 at around 8-10% I ran up to where the MT was standing and dropped the blade next to him.  The raids DPS let up until she had breathed on it, and then we finished the kill.   Once she was dead I ran up and picked up the blade, then stabbed Onyxia with it.\n\nIn order to save time, I set my hearthstone to Feralas in advance, then ran into DM North, took a left and headed to the library.  Once I spoke to the NPC he awarded me with this sword.\n\nFor some people it may be difficult to get this quest completed if your guild is not currently farming her or even attempting her at all. My advice then is to check with some guilds on your server to see if you can take up a spot at their next raid to complete the quest, and perhaps even offer them a little bit of gold as well.  I have had this sword for a long time now and absolutely love it.\n\nI wish everyone who plans on getting this sword the best of luck, and hope this post provides a little bit of insight as to what to expect.","date":"2006-09-16T23:39:11+02:00","rating":240,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":538,"id":285622,"body":"Good post but they come from Dusty Tomes (books) not Dusty Tombs. :D Only off by one letter but that one letter makes a big difference.","userid":33,"username":"thomasjs","roles":0,"creationdate":"2006-10-14T22:54:23+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":0,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":null,"importedSubject":null,"contentTimestamp":"1160859263.000000","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":538,"id":286344,"body":"He/she did say tomes, I don't see how he said tombs.","userid":9273,"username":"Thurissan","roles":0,"creationdate":"2006-12-17T12:45:16+01:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":1,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":null,"importedSubject":null,"contentTimestamp":"1166352316.000000","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentv2":1,"number":1,"id":3461,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"knofle","body":"This sword is the number one tanking sword quite far in the game.

That means by game design it's for Paladins AND Warriors. After that it comes down to a few things. Also, since the book itself doesn't bind and is a world drop, and many can be found for sale on the Auction House, it's not harming any warrior's chance to tank by a paladin having this. Simply put, forge all you want, they'll make more.\n\nPaladins carrying and using this? Not a bad thing, every melee class needs some kind of good weapon and Quel'Serrar is a good 1H sword. It allows us to solo and PvP quite nicely. I find other items are better for instances, but then again I'm a full bore healing paladin. I've since given up the dream that paladins can solo tank anything much bigger than Scholo or Stratholme, and they have special skills to help there. So will I use this sword when I'm in an instance? Only when I want to irritate our fury warrior, but that's just some good fun. I tend to rely on my Hammer of the Grand Crusader with +22 intellect enchanted on it, and sit back and heal and buff. It's what we're best at.\n\nWarriors, of course, love this toy. It's big, it's mean looking, it's also a badge of honor. Warriors with it can show the world they were in a group that killed Onyxia, oh and that they were fortunate enough to either find the book or the money to buy it. But that holds true for paladins as well.\n\nAs for the last part? Paladins tanking? They can off-tank. It's always been my opinion that a paladin's main job as an off tank is to sweep up stray aggro, throw a consecrate on the unattended mobs that may ag on your healers, sweep up the secondary targets until the real tank can come by, pick him up, and hold him still while your DPSers burn him down.\n\nOh... and Blessing of Kings?

I say this because in instances like UBRS, LBRS, DM, Strat etc. the warriors arent really taking heavy amounts of damage, more damage = more rage, more rage = more threat producing moves, more threat producing moves = better tank.  The mobs and bosses hit tons harder in MC, BWL, blah blah etc. which would suit a warrior much better because of the generation of rage.  A pally however cant change the amount of aggro he produces unless he changes upgrades his gear, DPS, mana pool, health, etc.  So, in my opinion pallies can tank fine in the less important instances, but once you start doing more meaningful things, a warrior should be more suited for holding aggro.","date":"2006-12-06T05:58:55+01:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SteveGunn","importedSubject":"Hmm"},{"commentv2":1,"number":100,"id":3064639,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Haha, whoever posts a \"Paladin's can't tank\" message has never had a paladin for a tank, my guild has the only paladin tank i have ever seen, last week in shattered halls 4 of our 5 man group wiped after getting Kargath down to 40 someodd percent, and our paladin tanked him for 5 minutes while we just sat there watching, then we decided we should go give him a hand, so she tanked Kargath for about 7-8 minutes all by herself, so give paladin tanks a chance, as far as i am concerned, they have every right to be standing among guilds as tanks as warriors do, and as far as weapons go, its not about the base damage, heck, your next weapon could have 60-70 more max damage than this but its not quite up to snuff if its dps is lower or its speed is slower\n\n[i][small]Edited, May 16th 2007 12:41pm by Artixkriegor[/small][/i]","date":"2007-05-16T20:36:18+02:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3064639,"id":1279133,"body":"While I don't disagree that paladins can tank, I have to call BS that he tanked Kargath alone for 7-8 minutes.

Rogues use their abilities to do damage to the enemy while the warrior uses his Rage abilities to make sure that the aggro is kept squarely on him, which allows him to do more damage than the Rogue, otherwise the Rogue would pick up aggro everytime his negative shouts fall off. Paladins are there to keep the warrior alive while doing damage to the enemy. Feral druids are unique in the aspect that they can do damage and heal themselves while the other classes cannot. However, they cannot do as much damage or as much healing (this comes from the fact that druids can reach 60 completely by soloing and possibly never needing a group, similar to a Warlock) as a non-split class (warrior, mage, priest, rogue - in case you never played it, those are the four core classes in old-school D&D) the split classes (Warlock, Paladin, Hunter, Shaman) are intended to be based between one or the other. Paladin and Hunter are tanks first and casters second. Shaman and Warlock are casters primarily, with added effects from the Warlock's pet and the Shaman's damage. So if you were going to build a list it would look like this:\n\nMain line:\nWarrior, Rogue, Warlock pet (Voidwalker)\nSupport main line:\nWarlock pet (Succubus), Hunter and pet, Paladin\nRear line:\nShaman, Priest, Mage, Warlock and Imp, if for some ungodly reason you use this pet. (I have a warlock, and yes, the Imp is in the Special Olympics with a gold medal. Get a V/W or a Succ.)\n\nThat is the basis for how the classes are supposed to be played as \"true\" to their class. \n\nThis is not counting all of the variables present,  this is just where the belong according to damage and armor class and what skills they use. Not intended to pigeonhole the classes (except mage, priest and warlock - no offense, just that you're casters and damage taking isn't exactly something you are masters at.)\n\nNOTE: This list is compiled based on the armor and damage ratings primarily and then skills and then secondary abilities (pets etc.). The basis DOES NOT take into account damage and protection that comes from items. This list is not intended to cure or diagnose any symptoms. Never pet a burning dog. Do not swim for at least an hour after reading. May cause feelings of having your face rocked.

But from what a few alliance friends who play Pallies tell me, Pallies get no love with weaponry and get shafted into specs they don't really want to play. My only opinion is that since the book states that the quest chain for the QS is multi-class Pallies shouldn't be disallowed to roll on the book or be mocked for having this sword. In fact I'd imagine that this sword would look pretty sweet with a full Lawbringer set and a Zulian Defender. So pallies, if you happen to be hitting Dire Maul and this book drops, try for a chance at it. I know I'm no help at all to you but I think that everyone should have a fair chance at it.\n\nAquisition - I was lucky enuf to recieve the book as a gift from my former guild leader who had disbanded the guild and was clearing out the banks for ppl who actively gave could get something back. I immediately flew to Feralas and snuck into the DM library through the North entrance. Got my unfired blade. Unfortunately the day I was scheduled to ge tmy QS I got scheduled to work. SO my girlfriend ran the run for me. Got the treated blade and I turned it in as soon as I could get logged on. She said the fight was hectic and she was nervous (Onyxia virgin, lol). I'm happy now. I was next in line for a Bloodlord's Defender when/if it dropped, but I won't be needing it now. So its getting passed on to the other warriors now. I'll still be keeping my Annihilator axe though. Never know when my weapon might break and its always good to have a backup plan.\n\nVesare - 60 Troll Prot Warrior - Paper Street Soap Co. - Vek'nilash server.","date":"2006-11-07T07:49:17+01:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Trazibari","importedSubject":"pallies and aquisition."},{"commentv2":1,"number":127,"id":3064666,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"i soo want this baby!","date":"2005-05-11T00:44:09+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"atreyuz","importedSubject":"want"},{"commentv2":1,"number":128,"id":3064667,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"i need to do Test of skull, onyxia and its mine ! i will send a pic when i got this AWSOMMMMME swords ! maybe in 2-3 week... not sure. hehe","date":"2005-06-19T11:34:56+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"onannn","importedSubject":"hehe"},{"commentv2":1,"number":129,"id":3064668,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Quel'Serrar Serrar...","date":"2005-06-26T00:21:15+02:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3064668,"id":1279158,"body":"Hehe, I always say the same thing when I see it..\n\nwhat ever will be, will be...","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-07-07T22:49:52+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":0,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"ariec","importedSubject":"RE: ...","contentTimestamp":"1120769392.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"shadw","importedSubject":"..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":130,"id":3064669,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"I got this sword yesterday (got the book at the day we were gonna kill ony yay =p) and damn.. it procs A LOT.\nSo far I had about 4 procs in ~10secs lol.. it's sick ^^","date":"2005-07-11T13:50:19+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Boytje","importedSubject":"got mine"},{"commentv2":1,"number":131,"id":3064670,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"hunter weapon.","date":"2005-09-07T12:22:24+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3064670,"id":1279159,"body":"it says that only warriors and pallies can use it\n","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-10-03T20:23:51+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-7,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"sapphirelegacy","importedSubject":"RE: i win you lose","contentTimestamp":"1128363831.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"phattylewt","importedSubject":"i win you lose"},{"commentv2":1,"number":132,"id":3064671,"nreplies":4,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"one question: can you pick up the heated blade before onyxia dies? or does this fail the quest?","date":"2005-09-12T18:35:21+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3064671,"id":1279161,"body":"yes, is better to pick up after she died, 1 warrior from my guild takeit after, me i put a shield on me (wisper a priest), click on it, shield wall, pick up and after she die i complete the q.\n\n- your hs need to be in CampM for a better timing :)\n- and put the sword when is 7% or less life and 40% or more of raid is alive :)\n\nEdited, Mon Sep 12 07:49:42 2005","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-09-12T18:44:33+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":0,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"flcaza","importedSubject":"RE: Question about doing this.","contentTimestamp":"1126543473.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3064671,"id":1279160,"body":"thanks! do you know what's the timelimit (after hurling it to ony's corpse and completing the quest) when it has to be back in the library? or is there even a one?

Btw that shield is horrible, 0 stats on it, and crappy equips that will unsheep stuff in instances, but so much ppl will want it just for the show.. :)\n\nBTW I just got my book yesterday on my 2nd lifetime DM run, gotta like being in a 5man group, noone to compete rolls on :) FOR THE HORDE! :)\n\nEdited, Sun Apr 17 18:02:56 2005","date":"2005-04-18T05:01:13+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"pataclow","importedSubject":"NEW LOOK"},{"commentv2":1,"number":148,"id":3064687,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"[url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~wlknier/pics/ragnaros.jpg]Orc Warrior with Quel`Serrar + Skullflame shield[/url]","date":"2005-06-24T21:46:40+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"eyesuck","importedSubject":"nice pic"},{"commentv2":1,"number":149,"id":3064688,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"","date":"2005-10-01T11:16:44+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Natsoromiu","importedSubject":"so this is how you get it"},{"commentv2":1,"number":150,"id":3064689,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Actually the process isnt that hard as mention forging Quel'Serrar.\nYou shouldnt even fail quest if ur guild has down Onyxia before.\n\nJust drop the sword between 3%-5%.(In front of Ony of cos.:P)Let her breath on it.\nSlay her.Pickup heated sword and drive it into her corpse.You got ur quest done.\n\nYou dont even needa pick the sword up like most people mention here to hit her with it.Looting the sword when attempting her will only risk youself getting killed.","date":"2006-01-03T13:19:53+01:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"extegi","importedSubject":"Forging"},{"commentv2":1,"number":151,"id":3064690,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"it could be HAXORZ or it had a healing enchant and to ever took this pic WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO IT WHEN YOU WERE FIGHINT RAG?","date":"2006-01-28T11:31:42+01:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Choasblaze","importedSubject":"answer"},{"commentv2":1,"number":152,"id":3064691,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Quel'Serrar, sera\nWhatever will be, will be\nThe future's not ours to see\nQuel'Serrar, sera\n\n^_^","date":"2006-02-08T21:07:56+01:00","rating":22,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Crugath","importedSubject":"Sorry, I HAD to"},{"commentv2":1,"number":153,"id":3064692,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"So, I did a DM Tribute run back in january of 06.. got the Book off Cho'Rush (we were all good friends and the hunter wanted the sword Cho'Rush drops) I went and turned it in at the library, got my unfired ancient blade.

I am a prot pally and i can tank through any 5/10/20 man and certain things in MC all with lvl 55-60 blues on...\n\nThe question is not whether a warrior can hold agro better. Its what types of tanking can each do better. Paladins tanks are built for AoE tanking...thats hold the agro of multiple, low-dmg targets. Warriors can in no way come even close in this department. Sure they may have a few makeshift AoE taunts, but they cannot sustain this. The only thing at this point holding paladins back is the fact that mana doesnt regen like rage...so if it is a long fight they will lose agro if they dont have pots.\n\nThis problem will be solved in the expansion. So paladins and warriors will both tank well in BC. But just in different situations. Even if a paladins can tank 1 mob fine, a warrior can do it better. That is that.\n\n\n[i][small]Edited, Nov 25th 2006  8:40pm by Glenan[/small][/i]","date":"2006-11-26T09:34:43+01:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Glenan","importedSubject":"Its not a competition..."},{"commentv2":1,"number":175,"id":3064714,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"For you all who keep asking about the proc on Quel...it's actually quite often...my crit line mod shows it procing about 19%.

My warrior never got it, despite so many runs in Dire Maul I could tank it blindfolded. And of course, since TBC it's been far surpassed.\n\nHowever....what's really nice is that my Paladin alt, a lowly level 37 at the moment, has Foror's Compendium in the bank waiting. 10 people (all level 70, of course) who know what they are doing can take Onyxia these days, even in a PuG. So I'm guaranteed to finally wield Quel'serrar, which is something I always wanted. It's an iconic blade, and still one of the best looking in the game (I prefer its aesthetic to the Sun Eater, which looks like a plank of painted red wood held together with wire) . \n\nSo...150 gold isn't really a lot to pay for that.

I'd decided she would be Protection spec, and wanted to have an ex-high elf wielding the 'high blade'. I have submitted a screen which I took recently, of her in her current gear save for this sword which I keep for sentimental value. As far as we are aware, I was the first Horde Paladin on our server to wield the sword (not the first 70 to do so sadly, as my levelling tends to be somewhat slow).\n\nThis is the part of the story that almost cost me the effort of 60 levels and the Onyxia prequest:\n\nAfter handing in the book to the library, you are given an item to 'drop' infront of Onyxia. Sadly upon my return to Orgrimmar I was a little careless and plopped the thing down right infront of the auction house, with a gathering of confused Horde around me. Red faced, I had to admit i'd just thrown away my chance at Quel'Serra, and quickly got in touch with a GM.\n\nI thought seeing as how the book was consumed and the sword was now sticking out like a sore thumb in our major hub, that i'd have to re-purchase the book. This is not the case.\n\nIf you fail in any part between handing the book into Dire Maul and bringing a heated sword back, simply drop the quest and the Elven librarian will allow you to pick it up again. In short - you haven't just wasted your gold if Onyxia *somehow* manages to wipe you.\n\nThe Quel'Serra is somewhat of a cult weapon. Considering the lore behind Blood Elves and Quel'Thalas and this blade, I consider it iconic to have.\n\nI tanked Ramparts all the way up to Mechanar where I took the Mana Wraith as a replacement with this sword.\n\nIs it worth the effort? Most deffinately, even if you're a fellow Horde with a long, horrible Onyxia attunement. If you're the kind of player who likes to have retro/lore-bound items and a great story to tell for your gear, go for it. \n\nIs it worth anything over 200g? No, simply. It *is* a nice weapon for breaking out into Outland, especially considering nowadays most levelling folk skip right past UBRS/Strat/Scholo and fail to obtain half decent Azerothian gear.\n\nI got many tells from people who would pass me as a 62ish Blood Elf Paladin and enquire about my sword. Most seemed more amazed that I stayed in Azeroth longer than necessary to complete the attunement.","date":"2007/12/31 22:59:07","rating":25,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"lastEdit":["2007/12/31 23:09:45",1,"Tydarius"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"wowhead":1,"id":211440,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"knifeyspoony","body":"Just bought the book off the auction house last night for 75g and completed the quest chain.

Good heals and a bit of common sense make this fight an absolute breeze.\n\nI got the sword at about 4:30am last night, and I am going to use it over my Gromtor's Charge... Yes I lose a few stats but I gain a whole bunch of style.
