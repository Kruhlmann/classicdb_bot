Effectively you can consider it to be the inverse of the defense skill.\n\nIn addition, against mobs that are two or more levels above you, you will have a chance to land a glancing blow instead of a normal hit. A glancing blow may not crit and has a damage reduction proportional to the weapon skill to defense difference. Weapon skill reduces the severity of the damage reduction, not your chance to land a glancing blow.\n\nFor example, against mobs three levels above your own, with 300 weapon skill approximately 40% of your swings will be glancing blows, and the damage for those will on average be reduced by 30%. With +5 weapon skill, you will see the same amount of glancing blows (40%), but only 15% damage reduction.
