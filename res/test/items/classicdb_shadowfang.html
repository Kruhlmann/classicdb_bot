I already have Cruel Barb in main, but the Shadowfang has a much higher DPS (17.8 vs. 15.5) and have been wondering if I should replace the Cruel barb in the unlikely event I should actually get the Shadowfang. \n\nI have a lvl 19 Rogue twink for WSG, and I decided that Cruel barb was actually better despite the lower DPS. \nFirstly, you can only have SF in main hand (bummer if you want to use a dagger in main such as assassin's blade from SFK) which also means you can duel wield CB. \nSecondly, CB has a higher damage range (30-57) so that means your sinister strike does more damage anyway. the DPS difference may look huge, but actually SF is only 0.1 seconds faster and has a dmg range of (29-55) so all in all I think the difference is deceptive. \nThirdly, CB gives you +12 attack power which increases your DPS by 1.9, giving a total of 17.4. \nThe bonus for the SF (+ 4-8 Shadow damage) gives no use to a rogue whatsoever. \nLastly, the drop rate on CB is about 10% compared with the 0.01 for the SF. \n\n\nIn my personal opinion, it would be a total waste for any rogue to purchase SF. That's not to say for any other class it would not be worthwhile, but I think the SF is slightly overrated compared to the alternative. \nJust think before you fork out 30g+ for SF when this is FREE!","date":"2006-04-13T05:30:48+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3010947,"id":1264651,"body":"How does the shadow damage not help a rogue...\nYea the low end is 1 lower on the SF and the high end is 2 lower, but the shadow damage more than makes up for that!

You can't get this blade every time you go through SFK. Plus.. in outland, let me tell ya, if you are in outland questing for an hour, you have a 60% chance on a green item dropping, and WOW, you have a 45% chance for a blue item, and the most amazing thing is that it's a 25% chance for an epic!!

If you were to throw 15 agility on both of these (Which 90% of real twink rogues do) that would give you about 39 Attack power, plus a decent amount of dodge. On a side note, this combo would provide the most dps (With enchants of course) meaning with 200+ attack power that a good amount of twink rogues have with this combo the odds of you one shotting a cloth wearer with a crit ambush is more often then not by far.\n\nBut for those that aren't intrested in paying out the ass for there rogue then Cruel barb/pvp Dagger is also a phenomenal choice. You also get +crit, +dodge, and +ap with this set, and you dont have to clear out your life savings just to stab someone this is obviously the best choice. It will take you a maximum of a 6 hours to farm the honor, and if you have a high level running you through dead mines you will most likely knock out both in the same day. \n\nIn all honesty, I would sugest to everyone reading this to rule out shadowfang. The dps is higher then any one handed weapon you will get in the 10-19 bracket. And yes you can always get the enchant on it blah blah but its less effort then its worth. The chance on hit is something that I personally think blizzard just rolled a dice and flipped a coin and thats what it came out with. The main reasons for not wanting Shadowfang is: 1. the speed is to slow for my taste. 2. the chance on hit makes me gag. 3. It's a sword. A rogue will lose out on the backstab/ambush abilitys if they group this with another sword.\n\nMy personal oppinion on this matter is, if you have the money, go for victory. I personally have 2 level 70's, stocked with a decent amount of gold on both. Considering I love daggers with all of my soul I'm going to spend my time camping the auction house for the Assassin's blade and farming honor for the Scouts Blade. \n\nThis is just my outlook on this never ending subject, and I hope it has helped someone.","date":"2008/03/31 00:00:30","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"id":"330964","body":"Hmm...i dont agree with that...
