As far as stats go (excluding the \"equip\"). We see that basically, the difference between the two is that skullflame has 100 more armor, on the other hand draconian has 7 more stamina. While the fire reststance is always a plus for people doing MC , the shadow resistance is more situational and not as usefull for most (BWL). I'd say with the tradeoff between armor and stamina , the difference is almost negligible. \n\nNow for the equip. The draconian deflector has +10 defense. Any tank knows that + defense is his friend. After the defense nerf, I basically need this shield to get near 400 defense. We all know of its use so no reason to elaborate (increase dodge, parry , enemy missrate , decrease enemy critrate)\n\nThe Equip on the skullflame shield somehow doesnt seem as attractive. The 1st one steals 35 life of enemy at 3% of all hits. Tell me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that 105 life every 100 hits isnt that big of a deal. The 2nd equip has a 1% chance of dealing fire damage. The problem with this seems to be that u can unsheep , unshackle and unsap enemies by accident when it procs. Also, it is not really the warrior's role to be concerned with damage. A warrior is best off focusing in his survivability. Extra defense is more needed for him than extra dps. Therefore I'd prefer the draconian deflector's equip extra.\n\nLong story short, for most people (not all [example are those going to BWL or having sufficient defense, which lets face it, arent many]), I'd say the draconian deflector is preferable. And considering the fact that one is free and the other 500g. It seems like a no brainer.

With my 5/8 judgement and some other +spell damage items, the drain life is at about 255. With a 3% chance, that isn't too bad, especially when you have 3 or 4 mobs beating on you.
