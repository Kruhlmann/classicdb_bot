This allows the newer Burning Crusades enchants to be placed on it. The Hypnotic Blade is level 34 and therefore is limited to the older (and on my server, extremely more expensive due to less mats in the AH) enchants. You can have a nice +30 Intell enchant on it or a +40 Spell damage enchant for a lot less than the older enchant (such as +22 Intell). This is also the reason that PvP twinks in the 29 brackets do the Master Hunter series of quests in STV since the rewards are level 35 and above.

poor, but 26 dmg is a LOT.&nbsp soul harvester is better for warlocks, but other than that theres really no upgrade till you start raiding.&nbsp so its good for 20 levels at least.&nbsp put a +22 int on it at a cost of approx 100g (depending on server of course) and it becomes FAR better than GBS.\n\nAs to cost.&nbsp Yes on some servers it is worth only 40-100g, know why?&nbsp its because those servers are new.&nbsp there is no base of senior players who have the time and money to really twink out alts therefore many of those in the market will have a much lower income.&nbsp If people cant afford it, they wont pay 200+g.&nbsp \n\nOn my server however, Doomhammer, new character creation has been closed to new players, only those with characters already on the server can create new chars.&nbsp that means ALL those players coming through the levels have high level alts, and therefore have MUCH more money.&nbsp Im wanting to buy one for my lock twink, but because there is 50 other people out there wanting one also for their twinks, and only one staff drops a week or thereabouts, the demand is much higher.&nbsp If i can get one for 250g ill be over the moon, in reality i expect to pay over 400g. \n\nNew servers = not much money = its cheaper\nestablished servers = much money = expensive\n\nis it good, hell yes.&nbsp \n\nalternatives.... there are few.&nbsp for warlocks, it may be worth running a dagger/offhand combo, the best in the range is\n\nHypnotic blade\nhttps://classicdb.ch/item=4015\n\nwith \norb of dar'orahil (or its fire dmg equivalent)\nhttps://classicdb.ch/?i=Orb%20of%20Dar'Orahil\n\nboth items are attainable about lvl 34 ish.&nbsp (required for the blade, and itll be hard to do the quest for the offhand before lvl 38ish, bring friends and do it early)\n\nthis gives a total of \n13 int\n3 spirit\n+14 spell damage (EITHER fire or shadow)\na useless health regen buff (stacks with healthstone, so not much good)\n\nAnother alternative is to simply take the staff of orahil.&nbsp https://classicdb.ch/item=13577\n\nas far as i am aware, there is no alternative such as this for other classes..... as shown

Well the 'Sleepwalker' does have less hit damage, making it less usefull for melee if you ARE 35+, but then again, a caster shouldn't get too close to combat anyway unless he is soloing and has no pet.\nAnother downside is the lack of healing/spell damage add. Quite a shame, But\n-Non 'Healer' type casters won't lose that much the healing boost.\n-Mages would prefer Arcane/Ice/Fire adds.\n-Warlocks would prefer other specific (don't play a warlock so I don't really know)\n--Maybe an overal add is better for more spell types with EACH caster? As a Druid I only have Nature spells, so I don't really know, but my Mage friend preffers to go Ice/Fire/Arcane, I presume most do, I could be wrong.\n--Priests use Staffs? If so they would sure miss the healing boost.\n--Druids would sure benefit both ways from the staff and with their limited weapon choices, this IS crucial.\n---Druids will also definetlly use this staff in Combat, so the damage differance IS siginificant.\n\nSo in conclusion, the Jordan staff is a nice moving forward from the \"Rod of the Sleepwalker\" the \"illusionary Rod\"\n[item=7713] is the next step up which is a pain to choose since it has less damage and no spell enhance.\nIn either way, the Jordan Hardlly worths 20G in comparison to ANY of those two staffs, which aren't THAT hard to get in the appropriate levels.\nIt's only worth those 20G to\na DRUID (as someone did mention before, but I further explained), who is about to reach level 35. \nAt 40, you rather get yourself an \"illusionary Rod\", \nAt 30 or less go get the \"Rod of the Sleepwalker\".\n\nAnd if you're arround 20, go get the \"Icicle Rod\"\n[item=2950] \"Emberstone Staff\"\n[item=5201]","date":"2005-07-09T05:18:55+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SillyWind","importedSubject":"This Staff is so OVER RATED!

Taking this staff as your weapon also means you will have the liberty of 2 free talent points. Why? Because you only need 3/5 for Flurry because you want to keep the speed above 3.00, and 4/5 Flurry would put the Staff's swing speed at around 2.9 seconds, which means you can't chain windfuries together effectively. The 3/5 Flurry would give it a 3.10 sec swing speed which is perfect for nasty ass chains. That means 2 free talent points. What to do with them? I dunno!

I'd [b]rather do a lot more damage hitting something[/b] with the POD than do a little more passive damage [i]while getting hit[/i] while holding a SOJ, but that's just me.\n\nthe added +11 damage to shocks is nice. (but not noticeable)\n\nthe higher damage of the POD *is* noticeable on WF as is the BOON of a slower weapon speed. This slower speed corresponds to MORE damage per swing per attack power point. (this is why there is such a big difference between WF potential between the two weapons, along with the POD proc).\n\n you could put three talent points into mental quickness (presumabely since you like a mix between shocks and melee). Then your lightning shield would be noticeably stronger and your shocks also. To do that you can only put 2/5 into weapons mastery which lowers your total melee damage by 6%. On top of that you are now wanting MORE mana and a larger percentage of your damage is mana dependent. bad news when you need mana for grounding totems, poison cleansing and earth bind totems.\n\nGearing yourself for mana as well as maintaining high crit and attack power to aid spell damage and weapon damage will be a challenge as you inevitably sacrifice a lot of potential damage from windfury in the process. \n\nif that's in the name of \"balance\" and \"being as effective in winning a game as possible\" - that's cool. However you shouldn't be rolling an enhance sham in the first place @ 39 if that's your goal. Go elemental instead. Much more control, better team support, survivability, healing, etc. However you will never be able to get 2400 WFS.\n\nFor comparison I offer that I have both a POD and a SOJ with savagery and I haven't equipped the SOJ in months which I think should speak volumes on how much noticeable the difference is between the two.\n\nAs for \"glass cannons are bad 39 enhance Shams\" want to try playing one first?\n\n>_<","date":"2008/05/29 12:16:18","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"lastEdit":["2008/05/29 12:23:34",1,"TheFastCat"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":11,"wowhead":1,"id":296699,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Abdullah","body":"[quote]you are forgetting the proc on the Pendulum of Doom... as well as the fact it has no cooldown when you compare damage potential between the two weapons.

So its only a plus, while you can always relay on 11 int, 26 spell dmg.\n\n[quote]you could put three talent points into mental quickness (presumabely since you like a mix between shocks and melee).

Who will win? I bet for the balanced one, since he can do notable dmg from range, and by the time both are in melee range, there is another surpise, Lighting shield.\n\n[quote]As for \"glass cannons are bad 39 enhance Shams\" want to try playing one first?[/quote]\n\nWell, I can tell you that you really don't need to all ready play a class, to know how to play it. If you have played against them, I'm sure you know what to do.\n\nAnd yes, PoD isn't bad it's very good, best for melee dmg, yes, but IMO going for spell dmg is going into the right path. Also basing your decision of what weapon to get, on a \"proc\" it is... meh.","date":"2008/05/29 16:12:40","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[]}
