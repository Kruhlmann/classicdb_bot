Clearly clueless Hunters, and forum trolls write this flagrant bull%^&*. Take a look.\n\n2x Dawn's Edge with +15 Agility enchants = \n\nFlat 2% Crit bonus\n60 Ranged Attack Power\n< 1% Dodge from Agility\naround 0.5% Crit from Agility\nand a diminutive armour bonus.\n\nNow, the absolute best Dual Wield combination:\n\nBrutality Blade and Dragonfang Blade/Doom's Edge, with +15 agility enchants.\n\nBonuses received:\n\nFlat 1% Crit bonus.\n55 agility\n&nbsp &nbsp which equals:\n&nbsp &nbsp 110 Ranged Attack Power\n&nbsp &nbsp 1% Crit\n&nbsp &nbsp 1% Dodge\n&nbsp &nbsp plus a higher armour bonus\nAND better melee ability. Yes ok we don't melee much but it is necessary from time to time.\n\nSo with 2x Dawn's Edge you're gaining .5% crit over 50 attack power. I know which one I'd rather have.\n\nWhether you go for the Dragonfang or Doom's Edge is totally down to whether you prefer Stamina or Strength. I'd opt for the Dagger, though the Axe does look awesome.\n\nWarriors: You have better weapons in all circumstances available in BWL and MC. The Untamed Blade, Draconic Avenger (buffed next patch), Spinal Reaper for Arms spec. Claw of the Black Drake, Hakkari Warblades set from ZG for Fury spec. And prot specced warriors in BWL should have Quel. If not, Spineshatter from Razorgore or the Bloodlords Defender from Mandokir in ZG would be fine choices. \n\nRogues: You also have better choices available than both the Brutality Blade and the Dragonfang Blade. If we're talking end game instances, the following should interest you:\n&nbsp Claw of the Black Drake (Firemaw)\n&nbsp Chromatically Tempered Sword (Chromaggus)\n&nbsp Vis'kag the Bloodletter (Onyxia)\n&nbsp Perdition's Blade (Ragnaros)\n&nbsp Fang of the Faceless (Hakkar)\n&nbsp Core Hound Tooth (Cache of the Firelord)\n\nI can appreciate that Shammies might want to bid on the Doom's Edge or Dragonfang Blade. I'd find that perfectly acceptable if I was Horde, but I'm not so I don't have to worry about it )\n\nI'm also not saying that the Brutality Blade and Dragonfang Blade are Hunter only. They're not. What I am saying is that Hunters should be given equal priority to them, with the possible exception of the Brutality Blade if the guild in question isn't in BWL yet, since that clearly is the best Rogue sword before BWL.","date":"2005-10-23T20:18:47+02:00","rating":33,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":2695972,"id":1169989,"body":"A very smart person (not me :P) did the math for how much AP and dps a weapon adds to hunters.&nbsp Being the class leader for the hunters in my guild I provided them with this information and it helped clear up any confusion as to what weapons they actually want to aim for.&nbsp \nThis information (plus all stats for most gear and 2h) can be found at: [url=http://wow.stoneform.org/hunterweapons.htm]http://wow.stoneform.org/hunterweapons.htm[/url]\n\n[b]Dual Wield[/b] &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp [b","userid":1933640,"username":"Anonymous","roles":64,"creationdate":"2006-09-17T08:18:47+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":38,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Ladylei","importedSubject":"Some stats for you confused hunters:","contentTimestamp":"1158473927.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"proveit","importedSubject":"A little math for you."},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":2695999,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Well it appears the average age on Thott is roughly 13.

This is simply because OEB's, a spinal reaper, and even an UTB have already gone unclaimed by warriors, so there's no need there except by newbies who don't get priority.  Plus, the Destroyer because of it's AP/stam is one of the better hunter weapons available to us for the time being (we're at Firemaw).  \n\nWith regards to this weapon, we haven't seen one yet, but most likely it would go to a fury warrior first if needed (which we only have one of), and to hunters if not.  Why? Simple.  Because melee weapons are what warriors/rogues directly USE to dps in raids.  Hunters only need it for the stats.  Same exact reason hunters get priority on ranged weapons over warriors and rogues.  \"Oh, but I do have to melee in PvP\" I can hear hunters that can't get this weapon anyway whine...  Well, all guilds are different, but we gear our members to help us progress in PvE, not to look cool or for PvP.
