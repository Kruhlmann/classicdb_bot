Alex is supposedly still an avid player and guild leader in World of Warcraft.\n\nAs Fires of Heaven were well known for achieving many \"world first\" accomplishments in Everquest, the guild was asked upon the release of World of Warcraft to not be the first to kill Onyxia.Blizzard felt too many people would think they had inside knowledge if they continued this achievement trend in WoW.
