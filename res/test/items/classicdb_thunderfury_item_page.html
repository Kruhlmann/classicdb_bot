Now obtained by luck. I've seen warriors, rogues, paladins, and even a hunter with Thunderfury. These days most guilds are in Naxx. Warriors have Widows Remorse, rogues have other Naxx weapons. Short story Many guilds just give this out to whoever is crazy enough to spend almost all of their DKP on it. \r\n\r\nThe reason why a lot of warriors don't take this weapon is due to the fact that it costs a fortune to craft. Warriors already pay a buttload of money towards repairs after raids. Especially tanks. Since the sword was awarded the right to be an offhand it has become a very much wanted item by Rogues. Even though the threat from the proc is insane, most rogues can handle it. \r\n\r\nI've seen a paladin with this sword too, he put +22 Int on it. I lol'd.\r\nAlso, I'd like to warn all hunters that want this weapon... Blizzard stated themselves it was a mistake putting them on the list. I've seen 2 guilds fall apart because they awarded a hunter with a set a lucky drop binding because he was willing to spend big DKP bucks on it.

I thought I'd do what I can to clear some of it up, and make a post actually worth reading.\n\n[b]Loot priority[/b]\nFirst and foremost. This is obviously rogue/warrior first. In almost all cases, your raid is far better served having this on a warrior than on a rogue. It is also more effective for dps on a warrior than it is on a rogue, since rogues rely on sinister strike (goes off weapon damage) for dps. Dual wield (fury) warriors rarely use abilities that go off weapon damage, making this ideal. There are a number of weapons in-game currently from naxx that are upgrades from Thunderfury for a rogue, however this is still the top dps (and hence, tanking) weapon in the game for a warrior.\n\n[b]Threat generation[/b]\nIt's probably a bad idea to give this to DPS class if you don't already have a tank with one, due to the threat generation of the proc effect. Every proc from a Thunderfury generates threat equivalent to two applications of [i]Sunder Armor[/i]. This is why it will help a tank retain aggro very well. The proc that bounces to 4 targets does [i]not[/i] break CC such as sheep, sap, etc. It does generate threat on them, at the value of over 1/2 of an application of Sunder Armor.\n\n[b]Farming the mats[/b]\nGenerally, a guild will supply a player on this quest with the Fiery Cores and Elementium Ore, as these are acquired through raiding. You will be expected to supply the 100 Arcanite Bars and 30 Elemental Flux yourself. \n\n[b]Thunderfury and The Burning Crusade[/b]\nIn TBC, improved thunderclap is being upgraded so that it's effect reduces the attack speed of the afflicted by 20% (bringing it in line with the Thunderfury debuff). This will help players upgrade to better weapons without being pressed to continue using Thunderfury for the debuff. It's extremely likely that epic drops at level 70 will out-class it.\n\n[b]Actual DPS[/b]\nTaking the proc effect into account, Thunderfury is an ~85 DPS weapon. However, it's important to note that a large portion of this dps (the proc) does not scale with gear. This means that as a player reaches higher and higher levels of AP/crit, Thunderfury becomes less effective. This also makes it good for a tank - a tank's AP/crit scales at a much slower rate than a DPS class (tank gear focuses on stam/armor/avoidance/defense). \n\n[b]Thunderfury proc crits[/b]\nThe Thunderfury proc does crit, but very rarely. The crit chance is based off a player's spell critical chance, rather than melee. Effectively, when unbuffed a warrior/rogue's spell critical chance should be 0%. With buffs, this moves up slightly. Certain buffs that increase spell critical chance have a noticable effect on the Thunderfury proc, such as the Onyxia buff, and the buff gained when fighting Loatheb.","date":"2006-09-19T15:00:20+02:00","rating":38,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"xarg","importedSubject":"Thunderfury: Facts not fiction"},{"commentv2":1,"number":29,"id":2721448,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Numidia","body":"...

That means when a rogue upgrades his attack power/agi/%crit and strength, 50% of that melee dps stats is not effected by the usefulness of Thunderfury.  Now take a tanks gears into consideration.  He gets tier 1 and upgrades to tier 2.  ALL the tanks gears are damage reduction and higher HP based.  Guess what... since 50% of the sword's damage comes from the proc that means the warrior doesn't have to have uber DPS stats to make good use of the sword becuase its Proc isn't based on physical DPS based.  This doesn't mean a rogue can't make good use of this sword.  It just means that Rogues can get swords with higher Top end damage that are more effective as they get better gear.  Tanking warriors don't focus on these stats so a sword that derives 50% of its damage through a proc is an ideal tanking sword.

It's got good dps, it's 9 foot long, and has a paragraph proc.  Oh, and an orange name.  You want it SOOOOO bad!  The girls will want to be with you and the guys will want to be you.\n\nYes.  It is awesome.  But is it worth it...?\n\nIt took me 8 months, 2 guilds, and 10k gold.  But the price you pay doesnt end there, and Im not talking about the 4.5g repair bills on it alone either.\n\nFor every 1 compliment you get, you get 3 counts of harrassment, and there are ALOT of compliments.  You can't walk anywhere with it equipped without starting\na conversation, or more likely an argument exactly like the ones here.  But onto the damage.\n\nIn 5 man dungeons, solo, and pvp, you will own.  It will be as good as you expect.  In the mainhand I get around 9 procs per minute over long term and I slice and dice fairly frequently.  In PVP it's total confusion with lightning and tornadoes hitting all thier d00dz. However, in raids, I don't notice NEARLY (repeat NEARLY) the dps boost I had expected.  Perhaps an extra 20 dps on a rough guess.  But while I was thinking about how expensive a moderate dps boost in a raid that was, I realized something.\n\nTF's main benefit is not damage.  TF's benefit is the proc.  Not the 300 (I've got a 495 max) damage.  It's the -25% attack speed.  On a raid boss, that's 25% less physical damage.  So, obviously, it does benefit the tank, but also the tanks healers, which leaves more mana for them to heal everyone else.  It doesn't matter who has the sword in the raid as far as SOMEONE has it.  \n\nThe argument about causing way too much aggro gain is like most of the arguments about Thunderfury.  They're made by people who haven't used one.  I've noticed very little increase in nasty aggro situations and certainly nothing uncontrollable.  \n\nIn regards to the Off Hand/Main Hand argument.  Anything short of a Grand Marshal's sword, Main hand it.  Period.  Don't care about your math, Ive tested it long term.\n\nSo, in conclusion:  Guilds should open up to the idea of a rogue having it.  I'd say it's benefitted my guild just as much as if the tank had gotten it and Im sure they'd agree.\n\nIf I could go back and had the choice to bid on that first binding again, would I?  No.  I would pass on it.  The effort put in is not worth the end result, in my opinion.","date":"2006-12-17T12:48:52+01:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Casmin","importedSubject":"Thunderfury on my Rogue:  Retrospect"},{"commentv2":1,"number":165,"id":3071631,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Beastly weapon, has great skills and also has some awesome stuff","date":"2007-03-23T05:05:31+01:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"WoWmanAddict","importedSubject":"You find this that great? well hell ya!"},{"commentv2":1,"number":166,"id":3071632,"nreplies":10,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Guess it'll be nice for warrs and pallys, but useless for rogues. \n\nNot worth the effort :/","date":"2005-07-07T10:19:20+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3071632,"id":1281712,"body":"Why is this useless for a Rogue?","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-07-07T10:26:29+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":2,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"jamesjiao","importedSubject":"Why","contentTimestamp":"1120724789.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3071632,"id":1281720,"body":"Don't forget that it not only does normal damage, but also Nature damage.\n44 - 115 Damage\tSpeed 1.90\n[b]+ 16 - 30 Nature Damage[/b]\n\n\nPlus its Proc\n[i]Chance On Hit: Blasts your enemy with lightning, dealing 300 Nature\ndamage and then jumping to additional nearby\nenemies.

Yes, the sword is a quest reward. A reward for the quest where you need to kill Thunderaan. And to summon Thunderaan you need both bindings of windseeker and 10 elementium bars and some other nice crap. So, there will be no \"ninjaing this thing from Thunderaan\" nor any n00b rogues with this weapon. No worries there.\n\n2. It's definitely a weapon for a tank. It couldn't be any more tanky even if the words \"For tanks\" were written on it. Also, checking the dps and max damage, no pvp warrior would specifically want this weapon either. The proc is awesome for both pvp and pve, but for pvp there are other very good 1handers that are easier to get.\n\n3. Thunderaan is very easy to kill. I was there when my guild did it. We were a full 40-man raid just because everyone wanted to see the boss, but I'm sure it'd go down with like.. 10 people. Very easy with a few good healers and a good tank. I'd say a load easier than most MC bosses. Thunderaan obviously does nature damage, so if you are having problems (which I would find weird), drink a few nature resist potions. All that Thunderaan manages to do is hit the MT and use some weird multitarget lightning bolt that does something like 1k+ damage. I'm guessing it also has some melee hit that sends one flying, since I saw some guildies fly in air.\n\n4. I doubt any server will see much rogues or paladins with this weapon. It clearly requires a LOT of work to get, and any guild that gets one will surely give it to their MT. Only if they get a second or third one, I could see a rogue or paladin getting it. I doubt there are any pvp-oriented guilds that even have this weapon. So it's pointless to argue about which class would be best with this weapon, 'cause it'll go to the tank and be used in pve mostly.","date":"2006-01-09T20:59:36+01:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"WeepNeep","importedSubject":"Will be given to tanks."},{"commentv2":1,"number":173,"id":3071639,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"were does a binding drop? either one i dont care","date":"2006-01-30T11:10:49+01:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3071639,"id":1281723,"body":"[url=http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/guides.html?guide=463]Quest link[/url]\n[i]1 Binding of the Windseeker (left) dropped by Baron Geddon\n1 Binding of the Windseeker (right) dropped by Garr [/i]\n\n\n","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2006-02-03T17:48:52+01:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":1,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Saania","importedSubject":"RE: drop","contentTimestamp":"1138981732.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Choasblaze","importedSubject":"drop"},{"commentv2":1,"number":174,"id":3071640,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"/agree","date":"2006-03-19T09:46:23+01:00","rating":-9,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"fayhughs","importedSubject":"yup"},{"commentv2":1,"number":175,"id":3071641,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Chromatically tempered sword isn't even on par with thunderfury.

Sure, last patch provided mageblade, staff of dominance, etc. which provides a measly +40 spell damage which doesnt come close to the dps of rogues, warriors,etc. \n\nGo reroll and find out what it's like for a change","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-07-08T02:57:24+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-13,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Kendow","importedSubject":"RE: ppfftt","contentTimestamp":"1120784244.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"saintioniel","importedSubject":"ppfftt"},{"commentv2":1,"number":186,"id":3071654,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"OMFG, this dropped from a lvl 6 wolf and it was me, lvl 60 warlock and 60 warrior and he rolled a 50 and I rolled 51, OMFG, TOTALLY AWESOME WARLOCK WEAPON LOLZ!","date":"2005-09-22T00:10:42+02:00","rating":-13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3071654,"id":1281738,"body":"get this kiddie a doctor...\nhe needs it badly....","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-09-22T22:49:23+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-20,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Wooga","importedSubject":"RE: OMFG","contentTimestamp":"1127422163.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3071654,"id":1281737,"body":"Right......","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-09-26T09:25:22+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-1,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"RhoneTheDarkKnight","importedSubject":"RE: OMFG","contentTimestamp":"1127719522.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Aspire","importedSubject":"OMFG"},{"commentv2":1,"number":187,"id":3071655,"nreplies":4,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"This weapon flat sucks for a rogue at this point in time, period.

(Although single target this weapon is legendary quality for a rogue or anyone else, from what I've heard about the procc rate)\n\nEverything else in this thread is either wrong, skewed, upside down or backwards. One cute example is the attack power in relation to weapon speed diagnosis.\n\nSince the servers are down and I've got nothing to do, I'll correct you, poor misguided uncle's son.\n\nAttack power functions this way, for everyone: 14 attack power translates to 1 dps. So if you're swinging a weapon with 1.0 speed 14 attack power is going to give you 1 extra dmg per swing (assuming your target has 0% armor reduction). Continuing on, if you're swinging a weapon with 4.0 speed and you have 1400 attack power you're getting 100 DPS, and if you're swinging a weapon with 1.0 speed and you have the same attack power, guess how much DPS you're getting? 100 (That's okay you'll get it next time, I'm sure). The only difference is that you'll be getting 400 damage a swing from your attack power with the 4.0 speed weapon and 100 damage a swing with the 1.0.\n\nIn short: you're wrong, Attack power translates to the same net damage (on auto-swing, for instant attacks slower weapons will receive a bigger boost from attack power) regardless of weapon speed.\n\nSomeone else (who demonstrated correct understanding of the effect of attack power) said that Ashbringer is bad for Mortal Striking. Quite the hilarious statement considering Ashbringer is a 489 top end Two handed sword with a 4.0 speed off Nefarious. You meant Thunderfury is bad for MSing, and it's clearly intended to be used for heroic striking.\n\nGreat warrior weapon, decent rogue weapon. Paladins and hunters aren't real people. They're zombies.\n\nEdited, Tue Jul 26 15:14:59 2005","date":"2005-07-27T02:00:15+02:00","rating":-13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3071670,"id":1281746,"body":"Your analysis of the damage dealt per swing is great but it neglects to consider that as a rogue only 30-40% of my damage comes from normal mellee.

Have you never been in a guild where the MT actually had Tfury? I've seen a guild with 7. Every single one of the people who had it was a tank. (With the exception of 1, who was a rogue). There's a reason the weapon proc slows down enemy attack speed, and I'll tell you this, its not so the rogue has to dodge less. End of Story, Tanking weapon. Level 70 Prot warriors still prefer Tfury over any other tanking weapon, no matter what its top end dmg is, because the procc holds a hell of alot more aggro than anyone thinks it does, and ontop of that, it procs on enemies who are CC'd, and doesn't break CC. As in, you sheep 2 targets and seduce 2, the tank's proc will hit the guy he's tanking, and the 4 others next to him, thus gaining aggro on 5 mobs at once, without breaking CC. And like I said, its a damn good amount of aggro for it being a simple weapon proc.\n\nTanking weapon mainly, so shut it rogues, you get plenty of &*!@ thats much better, you just want it because its orange. As for pallies, well, I haven't seen much pally action before TBC, but as of 70, i've seen pallies tank as well as warriors, so in what i've seen, they're a viable player to recieve one, as long as they're protection specc (or whatever its called for pallies)\n\nThis comes from a priest who's seen just about every instance out there (including naxx).

My dream. It's absolutely beautiful. For anyone who thinks otherwise, here's a few examples.\n\nProtection-based warrior: IMO this sword would sit best with a protection Warrior. The aim of a protection warrior are mainly just to hold mobs and provide support to other classes, right? Right. Not only does this sword massly decrease the nature defense of enemies, making your Druid and Shaman teammates do more damage, not only does it lower an enemies attack speed making you take less damage, but it also hits, in effect, 6 enemies. This is basically an area-effect taunt. It would not only do great damage to 5 enemies near you and lure them, but it would also do mass damage to the enemy you target, basically buff druids and shammies, and is 1-handed. It's also quick, meaning you could keep steady threat being generated and increase the effect of the talent and defense-stance given threat bonuses. It's absolutely best suited to a defense warrior, I believe.\n\nRogue: Rogue have poisons, poisons are nature damage. Buff yourself.\n\nHunters: Hunters also have nature damage. Same as above.\n\nPaladins: Paladins have a lot of useful things that effect lots of enemies, such as auras. Once again, like Protection Warriors, it would make a lot of enemies want to attack you, making you the main focus of the area, and also lure a lot of them to attacking your nice little Aura of Retribution.\n\nOverall, I think this sword is best for Protection types, but it's really good for any class that can get it. You'd have to be careful however, as it could also work against you if you're in a large place where there's lots of enemies, and you have a number of tanks who each take a couple of enemies, since you could unwittingly attract more enemies than intended. Likewise for Hunter and Rogue, you could pull enemies that haven't been aggro'd by anyone yet. Due to this, you'd have to take serious caution with this weapon, and maybe even put it away during certain battles where you can't afford to attract too many enemies.\n\nBut all in all GOD I want one.","date":"2005-07-09T02:03:12+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3071729,"id":1281808,"body":"\"+ 16 - 30 Nature Damage\" IS NOT THE SAME AS \"Increases damage done by Nature spells and effects by to 16 to 30\".\n\nCome on people, use your head (or heads if you're a 2 headed ogre).","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2005-07-09T05:35:49+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":0,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"kyouin","importedSubject":"RE: Beautiful","contentTimestamp":"1120880149.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3071729,"id":1281809,"body":"I know that, I was referring to the fact that it lowers enemy's nature resistance.

This is because a top rank consecration has a 100% spell damage coefficient over the 8 sec duration, and whilst only gaining 203 spell damage from the Magus Blade, it is then multiplied by 1.9x threat (assuming that you have Imp RF, like you should), meaning it crea","username":"jaxsonbateman","roles":"0","creationdate":"2008/01/22 18:17:30","lasteditdate":"1969/12/31 18:33:28","rating":"5"},{"id":"325255","body":"While I was talking from a purely threat point of view...
