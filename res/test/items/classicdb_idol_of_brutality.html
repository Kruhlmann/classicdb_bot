You'll also have to unstealth to open a gate.\n\n[b]Soloing?[/b]\nSame goes for soloing the Magistrate stacks an enrage on himself as the fight goes on. The longer it takes, the harder he hits, as his self buff seems to stack (SpellAlert stated it stacked to 14 until he fell to our group of 4). Even sporting >10k AC you certainly won't survive long enough for your bash to cool down. A group of 4 should do fine, 3-man it if you're up for the challenge.\n\n[b]Useful?[/b]\nMathematically, the reduction from 10 to 7 means 43% more rage when using maul, 25% more rage when using Swipe. For every fight there is a break-even point between your AC/Dodge, DPSout and DPSin at which you can use Maul and/or Swipe on every attack. Endgame tanks often knowingly reduce their AC in non-raid instances to gain enough rage to pass this mark. Once you get your hands on this idol, you'll probably never worry about rage generation again. Ever.\nIt's certainly rather pointless when tanking raid bosses (the DPSin guarantees endless rage), but farm runs are much more fun now.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n[u]This is for a bear tank what a ZHC is for a mage, and way easier to get![/u]","date":"2006-09-20T20:23:16+02:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Arborex","importedSubject":"Got mine =)"},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"id":2667858,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Idol of Brutality has been changed in the last patch.

Stealth-seeing mobs can detect you at a greater distance when you're stealthed than when you're visible.  It's an oddity of the aggro-range system.  Stay in bear gear but do your running in humanoid form so you can get Furor if you aggro something and have to fight.\n\n-After the first pack of mobs it's not necessary to kill anything other than Barthlias.  You can safely run between groups, or between groups and the wall.  The only complications are as follows:\n\n-Box traps.  Assume every clickable box is a trap.  Run past it to a safe spot and kill the rats/maggots/etc quickly.  Do *not* swipe when there's less than 3 left, it's possible to hit something that had been too far away to aggro.\n\n-Eye of Naxx.  If you keep moving you may miss them entirely.  If one appears kill it quick.  If it lives long enough to spawn two elite gargoyles they'll aggro a group and you'll die.\n\n-Walking patrols.  After the first gate there's some solo pats.  There's only 2-3 that matter, just wait until you know where they are and move when it's safe.\n\n-After killing Barthilas, zone out the side entrance to your right, reset the instance, and ride back to the front.  Once I got in the above groove I was able to start a new run 8 minutes after I'd started the prior one (judging by the time left on Thorns).\n\nI lost count of how many UD Strat runs I made back when I was 60 trying to get the Idol of Brutality and it never, ever dropped.

At the first one I got a pack of rats and then aggroed a pat. At the second one I had to fight a boss (Unforgiven I think), easy and dropped some blue gloves druid from an old druid set (BoE so can be sold at AH at least). Trash is not an issue anyway, even pulling 2+ groups won't kill you, they are really really easy, just swipe/mangle your way through. Only issue is that the zombies can stack several diseases and it's a bit of a mess after a while, but I was never in danger to die and never had to pop out of bear for healing.\n\n- If you have the key just follow on the right side. You do not have to kill ANY mobs before reaching Barthilas. Just stealth all the way, it works. With the feral talent it's really easy (especially if you are used to do stealth runs), just don't get too close to the mobs that can see through stealth. You don't even have to pull the first pack of skeletons, you can actually just go right through the pack and they won't see you (done multiple times). When you get to the door where you need the key, just go as close as possible to the door, change to caster and open it, I've done it multiple times and never aggroed anything except a couple of rats (easily dispatched with moonfire). On the other side of the locked door go on, a bit more mobs who can see through stealth but still possible to stealth through whatever the distribution/placement of mob is. Be careful with the clickable boxes (supply crates), they open if you run through them or get really close, and sometimes rats or larvas will spawn, can be problematic if you are near big groups - but after the 2nd run I got the hang of it and it never happened any longer.\n\n- When you get to Barthilas no need to clear any trash, just after the door leading to where he is there is a kind of corner on the right hand side, it's nice to fight him there because he has a knockback ability. The first couple of fights I had some problems (although I never had to heal except frenzied regen), afterwards very easy. I usually cast regrowth on myself, opened with moonfire then retreated to corner while casting rejuv and lifebloom - nice little healing cushion. Then basic tank and spank fight. I had 40-50% health at the end (about 15% after frenzied regen for the first fight because I didn't think of putting HoTs on me and I had several diseases with DoT and damage reduction)\n\n- Go out via side exit. Again you can unlock/open the door without  aggroing the nearby group if you stand really close to the door. The mobs look very close but at lvl 70 they don't aggro you.\n\n- Reset instance and start again. Also something I was not aware of, after 5 tries you cannot enter any longer before some amount of time (an hour or so?), it's a bit of a pain because of course the idol didn't drop in my 5 first attempts ;-)\n\nIt usually took me 4 minutes to stealth through, 2 minutes to fight and exit, 2 minutes to run back. The idol dropped on 8th kill.","date":"2007/09/10 11:30:44","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[]},{"commentv2":1,"number":12,"wowhead":1,"id":168270,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Ascend","body":"As a Druid, stealth to the left side past the Cryptlord boss,  into the gate that closes and spawns a few rats (which you will use Barkskin/Hurricane on) otherwise you will have to go past 2 groups of Ghouls that see through Stealth.
