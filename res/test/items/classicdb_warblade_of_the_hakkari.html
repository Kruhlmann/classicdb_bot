The problem with fury is that a lot of ppl dont know how to spec it, what to do, and what to wear.&nbsp Fury gears are very limited as well. In fact half of the best fury gears aren't even epics. This sword is by far, the best Mainhand weapon for an experienced fury warrior. For our mainhand we want a weapon as fast as possible to generate rage and better proc rate, but not a dagger b/c of the new normalize instant attack where daggers only get 1.7 speed of damage from AP, whereas 1h swords and axes get 2.4 speed from AP for our overpower and execute. By far, this is the best 1h sword/axe available to us, so for a hunter to roll for this over a fury warrior in their guild just so he can put an extra 15agility at the cost of perhaps the best weapon for the fury warrior makes me sick to my stomach.&nbsp If i were the leader of the guild i'd make sure the hunter understand this, and if he doesnt i'd ask him politely to leave the guild.","date":"2005-11-02T06:24:07+01:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"taintedsoul","importedSubject":"Fury Warrior's point"},{"commentv2":1,"number":9,"id":2680242,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"The offhand is great for any rogue because the ap bonus.&nbsp But, these swords would work fine for a sword specced combat rogue also.&nbsp Even though your SS would be a bit soft you'd get a huge bonus from flat % based procs.&nbsp IIP procs 30% for 130 damage, sword spec 6% for extra attack, HoJ 2% for extra attack.&nbsp The speed will help proc those and make up for the yellow damage.","date":"2006-01-14T06:24:07+01:00","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"raisinbran","importedSubject":"rogue usage"},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2680256,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Ok, first off lemme say I'm a Rogue, and I use swords in PvE for the sustained DPS and daggers in PvP for the burst dps.\n\nAnyone that says I would \"roll\" for this item is a retard because you don't roll in ZG, and those people should be disregarded.\n\nI can see how it would be easy to think this is a rogue set, but it's reallyl not that good for rogues. Sure you'll proc poison more often, or maybe get your extra swing more frequently, but the white damage on this is negigable and if you were going for that stuff a dagger with windfury would do the same white damage, probably more poison procs dual wielding daggers than this set. I'd take Dal'Rend's over these, because honestly I lose damage in a long fight because my SS hits are MUCH&nbsp lower.\n\nNow, technically this would be a great weapon for a fury warrior in PvP, but in my guild, since we just started doing ZG and MC, we make PvE items a priority over PvP items. Meaning if you wanted a sword or item purely for PvP, you wouldn't get it if someone else could use it for PvE. So we'd give these to our hunters. Hunters do melee in some fights, especially against the spider boss because you gotta stay close to the spider, and also because the stats on these babies give the same things it does for rogues: increased crit chance, attack power boost.\n\nNow I'm going to compare this w/ Dal'Rend's Arms.\nDal'Rends: You get 54 AP (4 more ap from 4 str, rogues only get 1 ap per 1 str), +7 defense +100 armor (good if you pull aggro a lot), and +1% crit. \nHakkari: 68 AP, 1% crit, and swords +6.\n\nHakkari only gives 14 more AP, which is negigable, and the swords +6 is nice, but not enough to make it an ideal rogue set. I cannot stress this enough, Hakkari does MUCH less SS damage, making this a BAD rogue set. Rogues, do the right thing.

Rogue, Fury War, Any Hunter"},{"commentv2":1,"number":14,"id":2680328,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"I'm a combat sword rogue, 20/31/0, and I just got the MH today.&nbsp The guild I run with has a zero-sum dkp system, and I was like 7th or 8th in line after all the warriors had a shot at it.&nbsp So to start off I didn't roll over or outbid any fury warriors or anything like that.\n\nI currently have Dal'Rend's, and I've been second-guessing myself over accepting the MH.&nbsp I crunched some numbers and basically what I came up with was, right now with the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's OH I'm in a bad place.&nbsp I'll do more dps with the set bonus from Dal'Rend's.\n\nBut AFTER, if I get that offhand, my dps will skyrocket.&nbsp I know my Sinister Strikes won't hit as hard.&nbsp And pre-1.8 this sword would have been a joke.&nbsp But thanks to the weapon standardization this set has become a viable option for sword rogues.&nbsp Yeah, if you're running MC or above there's better, MUCH better, and you shouldn't waste your time on this.&nbsp But I'm not running MC.&nbsp I'm not even in a ZG-running guild, I just raid with them from time to time.\n\nThe white dps from this set beats out the Dal'Rends set you can't argue that.&nbsp You get more AP from the two blades, as well as the same amount of crit, and you get a nicer set bonus.&nbsp And don't forget that extra attack will be proccing more often, as will poisons, since they are static % chances.&nbsp So the only real question is, does the loss in Sinister Strike damage outweigh the gain in white dps?&nbsp It does not, when you have both swords.&nbsp I used a base of 653 AP since that's what I have with my current gear, and I'm assuming you have Sword Specialization maxed out as well as Dual-Wield Specialization.&nbsp I'm also assuming you have a cheap +4 enchant on your swords.&nbsp If you can afford better, well, it's not gonna change the results, it will just change the numbers.\n\nWhite DPS is calculated as (Attack power/14)*weapon speed + weapon dps for mainhand.&nbsp Multiply this total by .75 for the offhand when you have DW Spec.&nbsp Add the two together for your total.\n\nThe Sinister Strike Damage at level 60 is calculated as Weapon Damage + (Attack Power/14)*2.4 + 73.&nbsp I did this twice, once assuming you \"roll\" the lowest possible for that weapon and once for the highest.&nbsp When I give you a figure for SS dps I averaged the high and low together and divided by 4.&nbsp I am also assuming you are spamming SS every 4 seconds (40 energy at 20 energy/2 seconds).&nbsp For easier calculations no finishing moves will be considered, but they all have static damage anyway except SnD which will only increase the white dps.\n\nThe total DPS is gonna be your White + your SS dps.\n\nDal'Rend's Arms add 54 attack power (50 set bonus +4 str on MH).&nbsp This means you will have 707 AP.\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp 163.9\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp 349.2\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp 279.2\nAvg Sinister Strike:&nbsp 314.2\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp 78.6\nTotal DPS:&nbsp 242.5\n\nThe Twin Blades of the Hakkari add 68 attack power (28 on MH and 40 on OH).&nbsp This means you will have 721 AP.\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp 180.0\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp 310.6\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp 259.6\nAverage Sinister Strike:&nbsp 285.1\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp 71.3\nTotal DPS:&nbsp 251.3\n\nWielding Warblade of the Hakkari MH and Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge OH gives you 681 AP (28 AP from the MH and nothing from the OH)\n\nWhite DPS:&nbsp 169.8\nHigh Sinister Strike:&nbsp 303.7\nLow Sinister Strike:&nbsp 252.7\nAverage Sinister Strike:&nbsp 2782\nSinister Strike DPS:&nbsp 69.6\nTotal DPS:&nbsp 239.4\n\nThis of course is before armor.&nbsp If you really wanna get into it you can calculate the extra attack procs and poison procs but I'm not going to.\n\nAs you can see, total dps the Hakkari blades win.&nbsp However Dal'Rend's comes in second, which

Vis'kag, BB, CTS... any of these will do great for SS dmg and a high amount of DPS, point is you'll get more proccs and (oh wow really?) more hits / minute with fast swords which equals to more proccs, more crits, more DMG. \n\nP.S. All hunters who says these swords are awesome for them... give me a break, these wont contribute nearly as much for you as they would for a rogue.","date":"2006-03-10T22:40:11+01:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3078955,"id":1285225,"body":"I agree, as an owner of this set, the PvE dmg you deal is still superior to what most fury warr's can dish out.

If you refrein to other comboes, the Hakkari Set will come out on top prior to the 20 seconds.\n\nSo yes, in long fights this set is an alternative for rogue's who fight with swords and do not get a  grip on a weapon better than Dal Rends Sacred Charge in the main hand.\n\nAs a matter of fact this sword could be very nice for poison specced rogues, as it would even increase the damage output by poison over time, thus already winning the advantage over Dal Rend prior to the ten second.\nYes a poison specced rogue with 3 parts bloodfang and a BWL trinket might consider this a viable option.\n\nBut other than that it really is not half as good for rogues as for warriors - EVEN after patch 1.8.\n\nOf course, if the +6 swords bonus can compensate for approximatly 1000 damage every half minute, than this set has a place even over Vis'kag, else get yourself some other loot target.\n\n---\n\nThe main hand clearly belongs to fury warriors before any other class, as long as the warriors are not primarily specced on mortal strike.\n\nHunter clearly can take an advantage from this sets boni and the larger ATK gain over Dal Rend.
