However you're not saying it's a hunter weapon anyhow.  \n\nThe proc is STR, not AP, so it belongs in the hands of classes that calculate strength as 2 AP, instead of 1.  IIRC this is Paladins, Warriors, and Shamans.  Pity that Shamans cannot use swords, because this would be a terrific enhancement weapon.\n\nDue to proc-style combat, this can make paladins very happy.  Crusader enchant, this proc, and a seal can ensure *something* happens every 3 or 4 swings.  It really makes a class with not (current) instant melee ability more fun.  IMHO Warriors (who go 2 hand) should desire more base DPS, slower speed, and more consistant stats.  For 2h Fury, a spec becoming very popular, this works out as a great grinding tool (+600 AP [take 45% for Bloodthirst]) but the proc rate doesn't warrant the stat cut for total raid DPS.","date":"2006-11-27T04:31:25+01:00","rating":23,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentv2":1,"number":3,"id":7523,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"clyemne","body":"absolutely not a hunter weapon, the 300 str proc makes it warrior priority hands down, plus with the agi attack power nerf zin'rokh would give way more agi than this even without an enchant","date":"2006-12-06T22:10:43+01:00","rating":18,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":7523,"id":285897,"body":"Warrior weapon first, but I've seen a good number of warriors turn it down to save DKP and wait for better things.

The likelyhood of it is completely dependent upon the situation. In my experience with MMO players, the odds of having a non-guild highly organized raid accomplish something like this are about as good as winning the lottery three times in the same week with only two drawings a week.\n\nUltimately when this drops, whomever gets it is entirely situational. Some guilds will make ultimatums that a Warrior get it because it's a high dps, HUGE +STR proc weapon, etc. Other guilds may allow or even give it to Hunters or Paladins in the raid because THEY CAN. \n\nThe reason Hunters want this item is because they see a high agility and a sick dps. To me that means they want it for PvP. And just to make myself clear on this, I believe them to be PvE-server Hunters who want this to PvP when they feel like knowing the edge this kind of melee weapon can give them. There's no sense for a raiding guild to give this to a Hunter, because how often do Hunters melee in raids? Not much sense in giving it to a Hunter who's just planning on using it when farming to save ammo either, but all that doesn't matter because when it drops it's going to be up to the raid who gets it, so maybe Hunters will. What's the logic of arguing this publicly with people you'll never go to BWL with?\n\n...I guess my argument all comes down to this...\n\nI'm going to do 40-Shaman raids on BWL until every single one of the 40 Shamans has this weapon.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nBecause it makes about as much sense as this many posts on YET ANOTHER public flame-argument of what classes should get loot-rights to certain items. Remember, no matter what race the toon is, the player is Human. That makes 99.04% of MMOers by definition selfish !@#%s. They want the item because they want the best for themselves and will argue everyone into the ground over why they should get it...reason is let go to constant argument, knowing that continuing the argument until the other side quits is more likely going to be successful then a legitimate respectful debate on the subject.\n\n:) That's all I've got to vent for now. For all of those going to flame me, enjoy. I don't care. Don't expect me to respond.

So when on a raid do u see Hunters meleeing in MC or BWL or even onyxia for that matter. If u want a pvp weapon, pvp for it. I know the agility is good, so is this:\n[item=19106] you are, simple.. 21 agility from an AV quest ( as i said pvp).\nDPS melee weapons go to warriors first simple because they can only dps on raids at close range. Maybe you hunters can all melee and have warriors stand back and range on raganos and see how far you all get. \nIts a simple concept: Warriors and rogues melee becasue thats there best form of damage, Hunters range because its there best form of damage. So hold your tonuge, live with the concept and once melees have there weapons, then roll on them.

Pretty much if a hunter had more DKP than a warrior, sure, they could get one of these babies.

My first preference would be for this to go to a warrior, but just me.\n\nEDIT:  My mistake, there is agility on it so a hunter would be get some ranged AP out of it.

If a guild allowed a Hunter to go for this over a Warrior then the people in that guild should just delete their accounts lol.\n\nJust sit back and laugh, don't get worked up over it.\n\nEdited, Fri Sep  9 10:33:51 2005","date":"2005-09-09T21:27:00+02:00","rating":-6,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Othendras","importedSubject":"Lol"},{"commentv2":1,"number":143,"id":3074254,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"How can you say that is a waste on a pally, That is insane damage and if we proc SoC with it, good god cause SoC is weapon damage based if your not forgetting Nilloe...not to mention who knows how pallies will be after 1.9patch, we could be a lot better then u think.","date":"2005-10-23T02:52:54+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"CDB","importedSubject":"pally"},{"commentv2":1,"number":144,"id":3074255,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"any one know the proc % cause OEB has the +42 STR and  for a fury warrior thats nice but this has just a chance to incress your STR.  so im just wondering","date":"2006-01-09T14:14:46+01:00","rating":-4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ValdtheDark","importedSubject":"proc rate"},{"commentv2":1,"number":145,"id":3074256,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Human female model with UTB:\n\nhttp://patchtimer.org/images/utb.jpg\n\ngod this site sucks ass\n\nEdited, Wed Apr 12 14:39:12 2006","date":"2006-04-13T02:42:25+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"ginblackhand","importedSubject":"hi"},{"commentv2":1,"number":146,"id":3074257,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"this is a gorgeous weapon. its for a dps warrior or hunter , or a dps pally","date":"2006-06-13T19:50:12+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3074257,"id":1282728,"body":"Pally cant DPS and hunter doesnt really need a ownage melee weapon","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2006-06-16T00:51:36+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":-3,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Skyblaze","importedSubject":"RE: gorgeous","contentTimestamp":"1150411896.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}},{"commentid":3074257,"id":1282727,"body":"Hunters need to stop trying to take melee weapons, get their quest staff and leave the rest to Warriors.","userid":183238,"username":"Anonymous","roles":0,"creationdate":"2006-07-05T23:24:10+02:00","lasteditdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","rating":0,"dataTree":1,"importedAuthor":"Shadowstark","importedSubject":"gorgeous","contentTimestamp":"1152134650.000000","imported":true,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true}}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"Detharius","importedSubject":"gorgeous"},{"commentv2":1,"number":147,"id":3074258,"nreplies":11,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"Discuss.","date":"2006-07-27T01:27:33+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"commentid":3074258,"id":1282729,"body":"Shadow priests and feral druids are one thing, but even the most rigid-minded raid has DPS warriors.

If u look at the stats on this weapon, the class it would benefit most are warriors, plain and simple. Paly's that want to dps and want it, thats fine, but u aint touchin it till every warr in the guild is wielding one first, thats how we roll. The Herald of Woe is the best Paly weapon other than the Sulfuron in the game, so if a warr wanted a Herald of Woe, well he'd have to wait until no other paly's wanted to look at it. Thats how it should be, palys cant do everything as well as warrs cuz id love to see a raid grp go in and fight Nef with no warrs and see how much they hold agg, and if u gonna post and say i seen it or did it, link the frikkin video. Now as far as calculations go TUB gives u 300 to STR. for warrs thats 600 AP! Add Crusader and you got another 200 AP. So it definetly would help the warriors out (no matter the spec). And this thing about a def spec getting it, so what if they do. Its not like they cant respec after it drops, i know ive done it b4 for certian weapons. Bottom line is you can all complain about how much u pay a month and what u deserve to roll on (rolling in the first place is upsurd to me for 40-mans, dkp all the way) but when you join a guild you agree to certain rules and regulations, and only an idiot would join a guild not knowing what those are.
