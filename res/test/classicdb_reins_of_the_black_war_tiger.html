Basically what that boils down to that it doesn't give a certain skill, tiger for example.  Also that means that you don't have to train the \"epic\" riding skill, which now costs around 720G. \n\nSo it looks to me if a level 60 Commander Gnome Mage were to want this mount (tiger), he can buy it and immediately start riding it because he meets the requirements posted on the mount.\n\nIf my theory is in fact true, then that eliminates the need to get exalted with a certain city if you wish to ride one of their mounts and it eliminates the 720G cost to get advanced riding.  Considering it is a lvl 40 item and you can't get Epic riding of 150 until 60, this makes total sense.\n\nSeem to me you just get Commander PvP rank and providing you have your first riding skill, you should be able to buy any of these 4 mounts and ride it without a problem.","date":"2006-10-04T16:21:28+02:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"2":true,"3":true},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"SonicSpeed","importedSubject":"Hmmmm"},{"commentv2":1,"number":27,"id":3063728,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Anonymous","body":"im a human priest,but i want the black war tiger, but it is only available to night elf etc...
