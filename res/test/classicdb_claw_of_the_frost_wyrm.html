Therefore, it was pointless for a rogue to go Fist Spec with this weapon, because they'd have to gimp their DPS using a low dps mainhand to match it. That's why most rogues stayed swords, because Naxx and AQ both had really high DPS mainhand swords to pair up with either Ibliss or Hungering Cold as an offhand.\n\nGreat weapon, looks very unique, but unfortunately it never really reached its potential. Only fury warriors would really have got much benefit out of using this before BC arrived.","date":"2008/02/16 06:14:14","rating":17,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"id":"341726","body":"Great analysis.
